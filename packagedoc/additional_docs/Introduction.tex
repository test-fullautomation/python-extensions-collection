The \pkg\ extends the functionality of Python by some useful functions that are not available in Python immediately.

This covers for example file and folder operations, string operations like normalizing a path and a pretty print method.

The \pkg\ contains several Python modules and every module has to be imported separately in case of
the functions inside are needed.

The sources of the \pkg\ are available in \href{https://github.com/test-fullautomation/python-extensions-collection}{GitHub}.

Informations about how to install the \pkg\ can be found in the \href{https://github.com/test-fullautomation/python-extensions-collection/blob/develop/README.rst}{README}.
